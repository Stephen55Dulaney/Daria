  "transcript": "Daria: Hello, I'm Daria, the UX researcher and I'm here to understand your journey while booking your Greenland vacation. Could you start by telling me how you first decided to plan this trip?\nDaria: I appreciate your enthusiasm! Could you tell me about the very first step you took when you decided to go on a vacation to Greenland?\nYou: Yes, you have my permission to proceed.\nDaria: Great, thank you. When you first decided to go on a vacation to Greenland, what was the initial action you took?\nDaria: Indeed, I am conducting a Journey Map Interview. Let's continue. Can you share how you began researching your trip to Greenland?\nYou: I began by, kind of looking online for trips. We decided we wanted to try to go there and so we went to some of the cities. We watched some documentaries about Greenland and then we found the website, uh, Greenland Getaways and we-\nDaria: That sounds like a good start. When you were browsing the Greenland Getaways website, what was the first thing you did?\nDaria: Yes, we're focusing on your journey with Greenland Getaways. After finding the website, what was your next step in planning your trip?\nYou: Well, we started with the route map and we started with where we're gonna land and where we're going to leave. And then we-\nDaria: That's helpful to know. When you were planning your route and deciding on your landing and departure points, what tools or features on the website did you find most useful?\nDaria: I understand we're discussing your journey with Greenland Getaways. Could you tell me more about any specific features on the website that made your route planning easier?\nYou: I like the feature where you could pick a start and a finish, and it would suggest stops in between the waypoints finder.\nDaria: That sounds like a useful feature. Can you describe how you felt when you were using the waypoints finder?\nDaria: Absolutely, we're discussing your Greenland Getaways experience. What emotions did you experience while using the waypoints finder to plan your route?\nYou: I experienced a little bit of escapism because you could just- you could kinda look. A hedonistic browsing, where we looked at the pictures from other vacations and then-\nDaria: That sounds intriguing. While browsing through pictures from other vacations, did you encounter any difficulties or challenges?\nDaria: Yes, we're focusing on your journey with Greenland Getaways. While enjoying the pictures from other vacations, were there any elements of the website that made this process less enjoyable or more challenging?\nYou: So, we can wrap up now.\nDaria: Of course. Before we wrap up, could you quickly share any final thoughts or suggestions you might have for improving the Greenland Getaways booking experience?",
