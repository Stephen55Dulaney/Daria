Click \"Start Interview\" when you're ready to begin.\n\n[Daria] 13:00:30\nDaria: Say 'Start' to begin the interview\n\n[You] 13:01:00\nYou: Start.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:30\nDaria: Welcome to our user study! This research aims to test the design, not the user. We appreciate your participation. For transparency, this conversation will be recorded for research purposes. Do we have your permission to proceed?\n\n[You] 13:02:00\nYou: you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nDaria: Great, thank you. Let's start with your background. Can you tell me a bit about yourself, like where you're from, what you do for a living, and how you got into fishing?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nYou: I am currently living in Austin, Texas. I got into fishing because I lived in Corpus Christi and my dad used to take me fishing a lot. I got into fly fishing when I was young. I saw a fly pole on a trip to Maine and I wanted to get one. So anytime I had the chance after that I tried to go fish.\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nDaria: That's wonderful. It sounds like fishing has been a significant part of your life for quite some time. Can you share more about your habits and routines when it comes to fishing? How often do you go fishing? What time of day do you prefer? Also, could you tell me about your goals related to fishing and any challenges or pain points you've encountered?\n\n[You] 13:04:00\nYou: The best time to fish is the best time of day. That's usually like in the winter, it's in the middle of the day, in the summer it could be early when it's cooler. But the fish know what the best time of day is and that's when it's best to get out. So pain point sometimes it's just hard to get to where the fish are.\n\n[Daria] 13:04:30\nDaria: That's an interesting perspective. Can you elaborate more on your fishing habits? For example, how often do you go fishing, and what kinds of fish do you usually aim to catch? Also, can you tell me more about the challenges you face in reaching the fishing areas? Are there specific issues related to location, transportation, or perhaps the equipment?\n\n[You] 13:05:00\nYou: Well, yes, the trout are in the streams and I don't live near the streams so I have to get on vacation to get there. I am close to the saltwater, but the saltwater is so big you really need to have a boat to really get to where you want to be. Our boat is not working anymore.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nDaria: It sounds like you're facing some location and equipment challenges. Can you tell me more about your ideal situations for fishing? This could be anything from the types of fish you like to catch, the environments you prefer, the times you like to go, or the equipment you use. What would make your fishing experience more enjoyable and convenient? Also, could you elaborate on the problems you're having with your boat?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nYou: Well, my boat has a hole in it and it tends to sink.\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nDaria: I'm sorry to hear about the problem with your boat. That definitely sounds like a significant pain point. Can you tell me more about how this has affected your fishing experience? For instance, how often does this happen? What steps have you taken to fix it? What other problems does this cause for you?\n\n[You] 13:07:00\nYou: Well, when your boat is put in the water and it fills up with water, you can't really fish. So I put some sealer on it and it didn't leak again. But pretty much every time I put it in the water, the water comes in the hole.\n\n[Daria] 13:07:30\nDaria: Would you like to share anything else, or shall we wrap up the interview?\n\n[You] 13:08:00\nYou: We should wrap up the interview.\n",
