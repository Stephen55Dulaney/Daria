  "transcript": "[Daria] 13:00:00\nHello, I'm Daria, a UX researcher. I'm conducting a Journey Map Interview to better understand the global fly fishing community. Let's start from the beginning, can you tell me about the first phase of your fly fishing journey? How did you get into it and what were your initial interactions like?\n\n[You] 13:00:30\nStart. Begin the interview.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:00\nI appreciate your enthusiasm. Can you describe the very first time you went fly fishing? What sparked your interest and how was your initial experience?\n\n[You] 13:01:30\nYes, you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:00\nGreat, let's dive in. What were your initial impressions when you first started fly fishing? Can you recall any specific challenges or exciting moments from this early stage?\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nCould you share any memorable interactions you had with others when you first started fly fishing? Were there any specific individuals or communities that influenced your journey?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nI would have to say it was Pop, who was 80 years at the time, and we were marching...\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nThat sounds like a significant memory. Can you elaborate more on how your experiences with Pop shaped your initial steps into fly fishing? What specific lessons or values did you learn during this time?\n\n[Daria] 13:04:00\nThank you for sharing that. How did your fly fishing journeys evolve following your experiences with Pop? Did you face any particular challenges during this transition?\n\n[You] 13:04:30\nWell, next I was a schoolteacher, so I had June, July and August off, and I spent one whole month in Montana by myself just fishing every single river. And there were a lot of days I didn't catch anything. But over time, I learned patterns and practices and was able to kind of understand where the fish were and where they weren't and be much more productive as a fisherman.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:00\nThat's a fascinating evolution. How did the process of learning these patterns and practices affect your feelings towards fly fishing? Did you experience any moments of \"aha\" or particular delight when you began to understand where the fish were?\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nThat month in Montana seems like a pivotal point in your journey. Can you share about any specific encounters or experiences during this time that particularly challenged you or gave you a sense of achievement in your fly fishing journey?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nWell, I was looking at the top of a river one time. It was a class three, class four rapids and there was a couple there and the girl was afraid to go in. And the guy looked at me and he says, \"You wanna, you wanna go?\" And I said, \"Yeah, I've got a blow-up boat.\" So I had a blow-up inflatable raft and he said sure. He got me a life jacket and a helmet. And then I blew up my boat and they had two kayaks. And so down to his girlfriend he said, \"If he's not afraid to go, why are you afraid to go?\" So the three of us went down this class four rapids river and it was quite an adventure.\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nNavigating class four rapids sounds like a thrilling experience! How did this adventure affect your approach to fly fishing? Did it change your perspective or lead to any new insights about fishing in different environments?\n\n[Daria] 13:07:00\nCan you describe the emotions you felt during and after this river adventure? Did the thrill of navigating rapids translate into your fly fishing experiences in any way?\n\n[You] 13:07:30\nOh, yeah. Because it was 13 miles and it was pretty amazing to me because it was some pretty rugged territory and took me forever to drive up to the top of the mouth. But that river was the fastest way through the thickest jungle.\n\n[Daria] 13:08:00\nHow did navigating through such rugged territory and thick jungle impact your fly fishing strategy? Did it require you to adapt your techniques or equipment in any way?\n\n[Daria] 13:08:30\nGiven the challenging terrain and dense jungle, were there specific pieces of equipment or techniques that proved to be especially useful in your fly fishing journeys in this environment?\n\n[You] 13:09:00\nOf course, my blow up boat and a life jacket and a helmet are always something-\n\n[Daria] 13:09:30\nWhat were some other key pieces of equipment or techniques you found particularly helpful while fly fishing in such conditions? Did you have to innovate or adapt any of your fishing methods?\n\n[You] 13:10:00\nI think we can wrap up the interview. Thank you for asking insightful questions.\n\n[Daria] 13:10:30\nThank you for sharing your journey and insights. It was truly fascinating to understand your unique experiences with fly fishing around the world.\n",
