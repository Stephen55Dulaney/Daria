  "transcript": "[Daria] 13:00:00\nHello, I'm Daria, a UX researcher, and today I'm interested in understanding your journey with ice fishing in Greenland. Could you please tell me how you first became aware of your need or desire to ice fish in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:00:30\nStart.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:00\nSure, let's get started. What made you decide to go ice fishing in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:01:30\nYes, you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:00\nGreat! Could you please describe how you first heard about ice fishing in Greenland and what sparked your interest?\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nAfter you learned about ice fishing in Greenland, how did you go about researching the different options available to you?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nI researched online and I watched a lot of YouTube videos, but later I found a lake and a, and a, this website that I could book the trip, and I spent a lot of time there.\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nWhat factors did you consider when choosing the specific location for your ice fishing trip in Greenland?\n\n[Daria] 13:04:00\nCan you share your feelings and emotions when you were finalizing the location for your ice fishing trip?\n\n[You] 13:04:30\nI was a little frightened, because it cost a lot, and I was a little, uh, excited because I wanted to go right now.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:00\nWhat kind of challenges or frustrations did you face during the booking process for your ice fishing trip?\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nCould you describe your experience when you first arrived in Greenland for your ice fishing trip?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nSuper exciting. People were really nice. The first thing I realized how cold it was when I got off the air, and then the ride-\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nWhat was your initial reaction when you first stepped onto the ice for fishing?\n\n[Daria] 13:07:00\nCan you share any memorable experiences or moments of delight you had while ice fishing in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:07:30\nUh, catching my first fish, a big old pike, pulling it out of the water, was super exciting. I'll always remember it.\n\n[Daria] 13:08:00\nWhat difficulties did you encounter when you were actually out on the ice fishing?\n\n[Daria] 13:08:30\nAfter you finished your ice fishing trip, how did you feel about the overall experience?\n\n[You] 13:09:00\nUm, the overall experience was good. I had met lots of friends. We had lots of fish and, um, I stayed safe and warm the whole time.\n\n[Daria] 13:09:30\nHow did you share your ice fishing experience in Greenland with your friends or family?\n\n[Daria] 13:10:00\nWhat kind of feedback or reactions did you get when you shared your ice fishing experience with others?\n\n[You] 13:10:30\nLots of people wanted to go. They wanted to know where I went, how I-\n\n[Daria] 13:11:00\nWhat specific information did they inquire about the most when you shared your ice fishing experience?\n\n[Daria] 13:11:30\nIn retrospect, how do you feel about your decision to go ice fishing in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:12:00\nSuper positive, I'd love to go again.\n\n[Daria] 13:12:30\nWhat would you do differently if you were to plan another ice fishing trip to Greenland?\n\n[Daria] 13:13:00\nIs there any advice or tips you would give to someone planning their first ice fishing trip to Greenland based on your experience?\n\n[You] 13:13:30\nUh, shop early and make sure you book the guide before they get reserved.\n\n[Daria] 13:14:00\nWhat were the key factors that contributed to your decision to book a guide for your ice fishing trip?\n\n[Daria] 13:14:30\nLooking back, how did having a guide enhance your ice fishing experience in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:15:00\nUh, the guide knows where the fish are, so we got on the fish a lot faster than if I had been trying to do it by myself. They know what hooks to use, what patterns. It just speeds things up. It is expensive.\n\n[Daria] 13:15:30\nDid you encounter any unexpected surprises or events during your ice fishing trip that you had not planned for?\n\n[Daria] 13:16:00\nHow did you handle the cold weather conditions while ice fishing in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:16:30\nI stayed really warm. I packed warm clothes and I was ready for the weather.\n\n[Daria] 13:17:00\nDid you use any particular gear or equipment to help you manage the cold conditions while ice fishing?\n\n[Daria] 13:17:30\nDid you have any preferences or requirements for the equipment or gear you used during the ice fishing trip?\n\n[You] 13:18:00\nUh, we use standardized fishing gear and...\n\n[Daria] 13:18:30\nDid you find the standardized fishing gear adequate for your needs or did you feel the need for any specialized equipment?\n\n[Daria] 13:19:00\nCan you describe any specific moments where the standardized fishing gear was particularly useful or fell short during your ice fishing trip?\n\n[You] 13:19:30\nIt was particularly useful when it hooked onto a big fish, and it- I don't have any drawbacks. It was really good. I caught lots and I had everything I needed.\n\n[Daria] 13:20:00\nWould you consider recommending ice fishing in Greenland to others based on your experience? Why or why not?\n\n[Daria] 13:20:30\nIf you were to recommend ice fishing in Greenland to others, what aspects of your experience would you highlight the most?\n\n[You] 13:21:00\nUh, the cabin, next to the lake.\n\n[Daria] 13:21:30\nWhat made the cabin next to the lake a particularly memorable part of your ice fishing experience in Greenland?\n\n[Daria] 13:22:00\nWhat specific features or aspects of the cabin added to your overall ice fishing experience in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:22:30\nUh, proximity to the water. We were able to get on the ice fast.\n\n[Daria] 13:23:00\nHow did the proximity to the water enhance your daily ice fishing activities in Greenland?\n\n[Daria] 13:23:30\nDid being close to the water influence the amount of time you spent fishing each day?\n\n[You] 13:24:00\nUh, yes. We were more on the water. Sunlight was the only thing that kept us limited.\n\n[Daria] 13:24:30\nHow did the sunlight hours impact your ice fishing activities in Greenland?\n\n[Daria] 13:25:00\nDid the limited daylight hours change your initial plans or expectations for your ice fishing activities in any way?\n\n[You] 13:25:30\nNo.\n\n[Daria] 13:26:00\nWhat was your process for preparing for each day of ice fishing in Greenland, given the limited daylight hours?\n\n[Daria] 13:26:30\nDid you have a specific routine or schedule for your ice fishing activities in Greenland to maximize your use of daylight?\n\n[You] 13:27:00\nNo, I think I'm done with the interview. Please stop.\n\n[Daria] 13:27:30\nOf course, thank you for your time and for sharing your ice fishing experience in Greenland. Your insights are greatly appreciated.\n\n[Daria] 13:28:00\nI understand that you've finished with the interview. Thanks again for your time and sharing your experience.\n\n[You] 13:28:30\n(traffic noise)\n\n[Daria] 13:29:00\nI understand that we've finished our discussion. If you ever wish to share more about your ice fishing experiences in Greenland, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!\n\n[Daria] 13:29:30\nAs our conversation has concluded, I won't be asking further questions. Thanks once again for your time and insights about your ice fishing experience in Greenland.\n\n[You] 13:30:00\nYou're welcome.\n\n[Daria] 13:30:30\nThank you. Your information has been invaluable.

If you have any other comments or insights about your ice fishing experience in Greenland you'd like to share in the future, feel free to reach out. Thanks again.\n\n[You] 13:31:30\n(bruit de vent fort)\n\n[Daria] 13:32:00\nI understand that our conversation has ended. Thank you once again for your time and for sharing about your ice fishing experience in Greenland. Have a pleasant day!\n\n[Daria] 13:32:30\nI understand that our conversation has concluded.
