Do we have your permission to proceed?\nYou: Yes, you have my permission to proceed.\nDaria: Thank you for your cooperation. Could you please describe how you first became interested in ice fishing in Greenland?\nYou: Well, I first became interested in ice fishing by watching some YouTube people that have a family in Alaska.
