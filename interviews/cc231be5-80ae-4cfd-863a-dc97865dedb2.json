Do we have your permission to proceed?\n\n[You] 13:01:00\nYes, you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:30\nThank you for your cooperation. Could you please describe how you first became interested in ice fishing in Greenland?\n\n[You] 13:02:00\nWell, I first became interested in ice fishing by watching some YouTube people that have a family in Alaska. And in the winter, they go out to these lakes in Pocahontas and have a heated tent and they catch a lot of fish.

Can you walk me through a typical day of ice fishing in Greenland? How did you interact with the environment and the equipment?\n\n[You] 13:04:00\nWell the typical days you kind of look where you are on the ice and you kind of walk out there and find about the Depth that you want to go and then you start drilling holes We had a big drill we put four holes and we had some flash ups that we hooked in some of them and then we put The tent together and in the tent We had a more of a square hole that we cut out with a saw and some seating and we had a moat heart Heater, which was a heart a wood stove and that's where we spent most the time that we would\n\n[Error] 13:04:30\nInterview stopped by user.
