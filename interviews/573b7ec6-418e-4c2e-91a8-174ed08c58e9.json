  "transcript": "[Daria] 13:00:00\nHello, I'm Daria, a UX researcher. I'm interested in learning more about your experience with the Fly Fishing Montana online booking tools. To start, can you tell me a bit about your role and how you use the system?\n\n[You] 13:00:30\nStart.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:00\nSure, let's get started. Could you please describe the primary tasks you perform while using Gone Fishing Montana's online booking tools?\n\n[You] 13:01:30\nYes, you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:00\nGreat, thank you. Can you walk me through the process of how you typically book a fishing trip using the online tools?\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nWhat are some of the challenges you've encountered while booking a fishing trip using these tools?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nUh, the hardest is to, um-- when you have a route planned on fishing trips, sometimes the guides are not available. Finding a substitute guide is, is difficult.\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nCould you elaborate on why finding a substitute guide is difficult?\n\n[Daria] 13:04:00\nAre there any features you wish were included in the system to aid in finding substitute guides?\n\n[You] 13:04:30\nUm, maybe a recommended buy or like similar guides close to this river because a lot of guides really know the river and if you pick a guide f- from a different river, he's not going to be much help.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:00\nHow would you feel about a tool that suggests guides based on their familiarity with specific rivers?\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nTo improve your overall experience, would you find it helpful if the system could automatically notify you of guide availability changes?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nYes, that would be a good idea. And also if there was a way to look at a guide and see what rivers he was familiar with and maybe score like rating one to-\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nHow would you envision the scoring system for guide's familiarity with various rivers working?\n\n[Daria] 13:07:00\nShould the scoring system be based on the guide's reported familiarity, customer reviews, or a combination of both?\n\n[You] 13:07:30\nYeah, common denomination of both. It would probably be, uh, better based on what kind of fish he's able to produce for his go- people.\n\n[Daria] 13:08:00\nWould it be useful if the system provided information about what types of fish the guide has helped previous customers catch?\n\n[Daria] 13:08:30\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the current system, and why?\n\n[You] 13:09:00\nI would say it's about an eight. I'm able to find the rivers I want, I'm able to find accommodations and I'm able-\n\n[Daria] 13:09:30\nWhat aspects of the system do you think need improvement to enhance your satisfaction?\n\n[You] 13:10:00\nI think we can wrap up, but thank you for asking me these questions today.\n\n[Daria] 13:10:30\nThank you for your time and valuable feedback. Your insights are crucial for us to improve the system. Have a great day!\n",

Difficulty in finding a substitute guide when the preferred guide is not available.\n2. The system does not recommend similar guides based on river familiarity.\n3. The lack of a system to rate or check a guide\u2019s familiarity with various rivers.\n4. The system does not notify users of guide availability changes.\n\n#Suggestions\nThe interviewee made the following suggestions for improving the system:\n1. The system should recommend similar guides based on their familiarity with specific rivers.\n2. The system should automatically notify users of guide availability changes.\n3. There should be a way to check a guide's familiarity with different rivers.\n4. The system should allow users to score or rate a guide's familiarity with various rivers.\n5. The scoring system should be based on both the guide's reported familiarity and customer reviews, with particular emphasis on the kind of fish the guide can help catch.\n\n#Overall Assessment\nThe interviewee rated their overall satisfaction with the system as an eight out of ten, indicating a generally positive experience. They mentioned that they are able to find the rivers they want and find accommodations.
