Click \"Start Interview\" when you're ready to begin.\n\n[Daria] 13:00:30\nSay 'Start' to begin the interview\n\n[You] 13:01:00\nAll right. Begin the interview, please.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:30\nWelcome to our user study! This research aims to test the design, not the user. We appreciate your participation. For transparency, this conversation will be recorded for research purposes. Do we have your permission to proceed?\n\n[You] 13:02:00\nSo you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nWhat factors led to your dislike of green eggs and ham?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nUh, green eggs and ham are green. (laughs)\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nApart from the color, how did the taste and texture of green eggs and ham affect your opinion of the dish?\n\n[You] 13:04:00\nTexture was just fine. Mostly the green eggs was the problem.\n\n[Daria] 13:04:30\nWas it the taste or the appearance of the green eggs that was more off-putting to you?\n\n[You] 13:05:00\nI think it was the appearance of the green eggs. I didn't smell green.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nWould you have had a different reaction if the eggs were a more traditional color?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nI do not like green eggs and ham, Sam I am. Not in a box. Not with a fox. Not in a house. Not with a mouse. Not in the rain. Not on a train. I do not like them, Sam I am.\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nIf the eggs and ham were served in a different environment or setting, do you think your opinion might change?\n\n[You] 13:07:00\nNo, I do not like them with a fox. I do not like them in a box.\n\n[Daria] 13:07:30\nWould you like to share anything else, or shall we wrap up the interview?\n\n[You] 13:08:00\nI do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-am.\n",
