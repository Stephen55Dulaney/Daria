  "transcript": "[Daria] 13:00:00\nHello! I'm Daria, a UX researcher. Click \"Start Interview\" when you're ready to begin.\n\n[Daria] 13:00:30\nSay 'Start' to begin the interview\n\n[You] 13:01:00\nPlease begin the interview.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:30\nWelcome to our user study! This research aims to test the design, not the user. We appreciate your participation. For transparency, this conversation will be recorded for research purposes. Do we have your permission to proceed?\n\n[You] 13:02:00\nYou have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nWhat kind of equipment do you typically bring on your fishing trips?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nIt depends on the river size, but I typically bring a medium-weight, nine-foot pole. I bring as many flies as I possibly can, both, uh, wet and dry, and I'm always in a pair of waders and a hat and a walking stick.\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nCan you describe the feeling you get when you finally catch a fish?\n\n[You] 13:04:00\nThat's why you go on the river, catchin' the fish and the fight. And then you get to hold them for a little- little while and then the-\n\n[Daria] 13:04:30\nWhat impact does the location and environment have on your fishing experience?\n\n[You] 13:05:00\nThe location means that you need to figure out what kind of flies or aquatic insects are in the river, so the location determines what kind of flies you'll be using.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nDo you use any tools or techniques to identify the type of flies in the river?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nYes. You pick up a rock and you look on the bottom and you see what's in there, and then sometimes when you catch a medium-sized fish, you can suck out its stomach and spit the contents in your hand and see what they're eating.\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nCan you share how fishing has impacted your life outside of the actual activity?\n\n[You] 13:07:00\nWell, I guess it's given me some joy outside of the activity. I'd tie flies on the weekends and there's been some recreation like that.\n\n[Daria] 13:07:30\nWould you like to share anything else, or shall we wrap up the interview?\n\n[You] 13:08:00\nNo, thank you. Let's wrap up the interview.\n",
