  "transcript": "Daria: Hello, I'm Daria, a UX researcher. I'm interested in understanding your journey with Fly Fishing in Montana. Could you please share how you first became aware of this experience?\nYou: All right, begin the interview. (car engine rumbles)\nDaria: Sure, let's dive in. Can you tell me where you first heard about fly fishing in Montana?\nYou: (music plays)\nDaria: I see that there might be some background noise. But when you have a moment, can you recall where or how you learned about fly fishing in Montana?\nDaria: Could you please describe your initial impressions or feelings when you discovered fly fishing in Montana?\nYou: Wow, Montana, the rivers are really big and when I saw the size of the fish, that was really one of the things that changed my mind. There's so much snow melt that the rivers compared to Colorado or even Oregon are just bigger and they hold more fish and they're more complicated.\nDaria: That sounds like a fascinating realization. Can you tell me more about the process you went through when considering whether to start fly fishing in Montana?\nDaria: What were some of the factors you deliberated before deciding to fly fish in Montana?\nYou: I check the river reports, and then I also look at the guides and the price of the guides because some of those rivers are so big you really need a float boat. You need to have a guide access, so that determines whether I could go there or maybe, uh, do it yourself.\nDaria: It seems like preparation plays a significant role. Could you please share about the final decision-making process and what led you to choose Montana for fly fishing?\nDaria: What were your initial experiences like when you first started fly fishing in Montana?\nYou: When I first fly fished in Montana, I was probably the only guy to strike out on the Bighorn River, because it's one of the fishes... But the fish were so... seen so many flies and they've been overfished so much, even though they were big if you caught 'em. I didn't catch any. So I had to learn how to present my fly at a whole different level than, than, you know, fly fishing on-\nDaria: That sounds like a challenging start. Can you share more about how you developed your skills over time to improve your fly presentation?\nDaria: What specific strategies or techniques did you adopt to improve your fly presentation?\nYou: Probably nymphing, trying to learn how to go underwater and working with a strike indicator and be able to see when a striking-\nDaria: Could you describe any challenges you faced while learning to use the nymphing technique and how you overcame them?\nDaria: Can you share any particular moments of success or delight you experienced while fly fishing in Montana?\nYou: We can wrap up. Thank you, wrap up.\nDaria: It was a pleasure talking with you about your fly fishing experiences in Montana. Thank you for your time and valuable insights.",
