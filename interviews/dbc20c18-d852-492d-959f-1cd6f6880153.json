  "transcript": "Daria: Hello, I'm Daria, a UX researcher. I would like to understand more about your experience with Fly Fishing in Montana. Could you please start by telling me your age, your role in relation to fly fishing, and your level of experience?\nYou: Start. Start. Start.\nDaria: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but could you please share your actual experience with Fly Fishing in Montana, starting with your age, your role in relation to fly fishing, and your level of experience?\nYou: Yes, please proceed.\nDaria: Great, thank you. Could you please share your age, your role in relation to fly fishing, and your level of experience?\nDaria: What is your experience level with fly fishing in Montana?\nYou: I'm pretty experienced. I've been there a couple of times and I fished for many, many years, but um... And I spent one summer there, so I'd say I'm decent.\nDaria: That's quite a respectable level of experience. Could you tell me a bit more about your typical workflow when you go fly fishing in Montana?\nDaria: Could you describe your typical process when preparing for a fly fishing trip in Montana?\nYou: Uh, I start by tying a lot of flies when I'm anticipating. I usually go visit the rivers reports where I'm going to be fishing, and then I like to kind of see pictures of what other people are catching, and then look at forecast weather and when hatches will be happening when I'm there.\nDaria: What factors do you consider when deciding which flies to tie?\nDaria: How do you use the river reports and other people's catches to plan your own fishing approach?\nYou: Well, you can kind of see what other people are catching. A lot of times they'll show you what fly or what pattern they use, so you can even just tell by looking if they're nymphing or they're dry fly-fishing. The river reports also tell you ti- uh, high ti- you know, flow rates and peak times of the hatch, so that's a good way to plan what you need to bring.\nDaria: What challenges or frustrations have you encountered when planning and executing your fly fishing trips in Montana?\nDaria: Can you recall any specific instances where the river conditions didn't match your expectations and how that affected your fly fishing experience?\nYou: Oh, yes. That happens a lot. Typically, when there's, uh-\nDaria: Could you elaborate on how these unexpected conditions have affected your fly fishing experience?\nDaria: What strategies or approaches do you use to adapt when the river conditions don't match your expectations?\nYou: You gotta figure out where the fish went because they're not gonna be where you expected them to be. So when the river's up or the river's cloudy, you gotta go figure out where the fish are hiding.\nDaria: What motivates you most about fly fishing in Montana, despite the challenges you've mentioned?\nYou: No, I'm fine. That was a good interview. Thank you for listening to my answers.\nDaria: I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the interview. If there's anything else you'd like to share about your fly fishing experiences in Montana, feel free to do so.",
