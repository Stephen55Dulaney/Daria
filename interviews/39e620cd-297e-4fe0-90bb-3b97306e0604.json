Click \"Start Interview\" when you're ready to begin.\nDaria: Say 'Start' to begin the interview\nYou: Start, start.\nDaria: Welcome to our user study! This research aims to test the design, not the user. We appreciate your participation. For transparency, this conversation will be recorded for research purposes. Do we have your permission to proceed?\nYou: Yes, you have my permission to proceed. Please proceed. Yes, please proceed. And then stop listening. Yes, yes, yes.\nDaria: Great! Thank you for your permission. Can you please tell me a bit about yourself, such as your age, occupation, and hobbies? Also, could you tell me about your experience with fishing - how often you go, why you enjoy it, any challenges you face, and anything else you think is relevant?\nYou: My age is in my 60s. I've been fishing my whole life. I try to fish any time I get the chance. I try to teach my boys how to fish. There's something about fishing that teaches you patience and just also the random reward that is just kind of out there.\nDaria: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're not just an avid fisherman, but also a mentor who imparts valuable life lessons through fishing. Can you please tell me more about your usual fishing routine? How often do you go fishing? What kind of fishing gear do you usually use? Are there any challenges or frustrations you encounter during your fishing trips?\nYou: Fly fishing\nDaria: That's great! Fly fishing is a unique and fascinating hobby. To better understand your experiences and needs, I'd like to ask you a few questions:\n\n1. Could you please tell me about your background in fly fishing? How long have you been doing it and how did you get started?\n2. What are your typical behaviors during a fly fishing session? For example, how often do you go, what equipment do you use, and what techniques do you employ?\n3. What are your goals when you go fly fishing? Are they more towards relaxation, catching as many fish as possible, or something else?\n4. Have you encountered any pain points or challenges in your fly fishing experience? If so, could you please describe them?\n5. What kind of solutions or improvements would you like to see in the current fly fishing experience or equipment?\nYou: That is an awful long question. I've fly fished for a long time, I love it, and that's all I can say.\nDaria: I understand, let's break it down a bit. Since you've been fly fishing for a long time, could you tell me what particular aspects you love about it? What keeps you coming back to it? And are there any challenges or pain points you've encountered in your fly fishing journey?\nYou: Yeah, sometimes you don't catch fish, but I keep coming back because there's always a chance today you catch fish.\nDaria: That's a great perspective. Can you tell me more about your motivations for fishing? Do you typically go fishing alone or with others? What kind of goals do you set for yourself each time you go? And can you describe any challenges or frustrations you've encountered while fishing?\nYou: Sometimes, it's frustrating when you don't know where the fish are. Try everything and nothing works.\nDaria: Would you like to share anything else, or shall we wrap up the interview?\nYou: Please wrap up the interview.\nDaria: Thank you for your time.
