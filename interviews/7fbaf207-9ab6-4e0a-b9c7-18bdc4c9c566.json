  "transcript": "[Daria] 13:00:00\nHello! I'm Daria, a UX researcher. Click \"Start Interview\" when you're ready to begin.\n\n[Daria] 13:00:30\nSay 'Start' to begin the interview\n\n[You] 13:01:00\nAll right.\n\n[Daria] 13:01:30\nI didn't catch that. Please say 'Start' or 'Yes' to begin the interview.\n\n[You] 13:02:00\nYes, start. Start. Yes.\n\n[Daria] 13:02:30\nWelcome to our user study! This research aims to test the design, not the user. We appreciate your participation. For transparency, this conversation will be recorded for research purposes. Do we have your permission to proceed?\n\n[You] 13:03:00\nYes, you have my permission to proceed.\n\n[Daria] 13:03:30\nWhat are some features of the app that you find most helpful in your fishing activities?\n\n[You] 13:04:00\nI like the river report, that's the most. And then I also like to see who's on the river and the pictures that it shares of people on the river.\n\n[Daria] 13:04:30\nHave you ever had difficulty navigating the app or finding certain features that you wanted to use?\n\n[You] 13:05:00\nWell, using the app with one hand, a lot of times you have a fishing pole in one hand with a fish and you're trying to take a picture. So the thumb navigation could be improved. Otherwise, the navigation is very nicely structured.\n\n[Daria] 13:05:30\nCould you provide any specific features or design elements that you think would make one-handed navigation easier?\n\n[You] 13:06:00\nI think that you should place, like, the important tools for the river in the radius of the thumb so you can hold your phone in your right hand and then the thumb can reach to take a picture or any other tool you need to use.\n\n[Daria] 13:06:30\nDoes the app's current visual design facilitate your understanding and use of its features?\n\n[You] 13:07:00\nYes, it clearly features large fish and fishing activities and how to get there.\n\n[Daria] 13:07:30\nIs there any additional information or functionality you believe would enhance your fishing experience if included in the app?\n\n[You] 13:08:00\nI would like to have maybe, um, coupons for a free guide.\n\n[Daria] 13:08:30\nWould you like to share anything else, or shall we wrap up the interview?\n\n[You] 13:09:00\nLet's wrap up the interview.\n",
