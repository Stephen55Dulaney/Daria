Interview Structure Analysis:\n   - Assess the overall interview flow:\n     \u2022 Introduction effectiveness and rapport building\n     \u2022 Logical progression of topics\n     \u2022 Appropriate transitions between sections\n     \u2022 Time balance across different topics\n     \u2022 Closure completeness\n\n3. Follow-up Question Evaluation:\n   - Identify missed opportunities for follow-up questions\n   - Evaluate the effectiveness of follow-ups that were asked\n   - Suggest alternative follow-ups that could have yielded deeper insights\n\n4. Response Analysis:\n   - Areas where the participant gave particularly rich responses\n   - Topics where responses were limited or surface-level\n   - Signs of participant confusion or hesitation\n   - Evidence of trust and openness in the conversation\n\n5. Script Improvement Recommendations:\n   - Specific questions that should be reworded or replaced\n   - Additional questions that would enhance future interviews\n   - Structural changes to improve interview flow\n   - Techniques to improve rapport and response depth\n\nFor each observation, provide specific examples from the transcript and suggest concrete improvements for future interviews.
