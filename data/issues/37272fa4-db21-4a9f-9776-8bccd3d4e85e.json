  "description": "Can we add links to Trouble Shooting guide to any service that is in the red. On the http://127.0.0.1:5025/static/debug_toolkit.html page at the top there are red green indicators for the four required services. When one is red can we have a link to a trouble shooting guide that will tell me which python scripts to run to directly start the service or any custom made utility shell script that are usefull in trouble shooting missing or down services. Also include what fall back is in place so that if they want to proceed with the service down they will know what functionality is in place as a fall back for the down service. ",
