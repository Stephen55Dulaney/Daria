How does the presence of this debugging box impact your perception of the system's performance or your ability to navigate through the interface effectively?\n\nParticipant:  I guess I would ask again if maybe we get the audio levels animator if it doesn't break anything but it was pretty useful cuz you can't really set the threshold unless you can see the audio level down\n\nModerator: Participant, it's interesting to hear about your experience with the audio levels animator and how it was useful for setting thresholds. Could you explain more about how having access to the audio levels animator specifically helped you in your tasks or workflow? Are there any specific examples you can share where the audio levels animator made a significant difference in your testing process or interactions with the system?\n\nParticipant:  directions kind of meaningless without that then but I don't want to break anything\n\nModerator: Participant, it sounds like having clear directions is crucial for your testing process. Could you elaborate on what specific aspects of the directions or guidance provided are currently lacking or unclear? How do these unclear directions impact your ability to navigate through the system effectively, and what improvements do you believe would help in providing more meaningful guidance without the risk of breaking anything?\n\nParticipant:  what is this page here going on it's doing something funny\n\nModerator: Participant, it seems like you've encountered something unusual or unexpected on the page you're currently exploring. Could you elaborate on what specifically you find funny or strange about the page's behavior? How does this unexpected element impact your understanding or interaction with the system at this point in your testing process?\n\nParticipant:  okay I'm going to put that as a screenshot\n\nModerator: Participant, it's great that you're planning to capture the unusual behavior on the page as a screenshot. Could you describe what specifically you find noteworthy or concerning about the content or functionality you're capturing in the screenshot? How do you usually use screenshots to document issues or share findings during your testing process?\n\nParticipant:  and then I'm going to bed\n\nModerator: Participant, before you head to bed, I'm curious to know if there were any specific aspects of the system or any particular features that stood out to you during this testing session. Was there anything that particularly impressed you or that you found challenging?\n\nParticipant: yeah I'm trying to understand these different pages and this one just came up so they are a bit out of order but I'm trying to understand if the monitoring with work based on this\n\nModerator: Participant, it sounds like you're currently navigating through different pages that are appearing somewhat out of order.

When you mention the system test message, could you explain more about what that message entails and how it's affecting your ability to track the conversation effectively? Additionally, how would having clearer visibility into the current conversation impact your understanding or workflow within the system?\n\nParticipant: Provide an example\n\nParticipant: What would you change?\n\nParticipant: okay well the monitoring page is critical cuz we're going to be doing these remote interviews and this is a way for you in the office to watch the interview as a progresses and then also if the monitoring tool is live it makes suggested questions which are not updating it also takes notes so  there's got to be some little issue here with the money but I am using you as a test tool I don't know if that's hooked up to monitoring\n\nModerator: Participant, it's clear that the monitoring page is crucial for conducting remote interviews effectively. You mentioned that the monitoring tool is supposed to make suggested questions, but they are not updating as expected. Can you elaborate on how these outdated suggested questions impact the flow of the interview or your ability to conduct it smoothly?
