Technical Landscape:\n   - Existing systems and integration points:\n     - Quote: \"Our CRM system currently doesn't integrate with the e-commerce platform.\"\n     - Analysis: Lack of integration between CRM and e-commerce systems indicates a technical gap that needs to be addressed.\n   - Technical constraints or limitations:\n     - Quote: \"Our website's load time is slower than industry standards.\"\n     - Analysis: Slow website load time is a technical constraint that can impact user experience and conversion rates.\n   - Assumptions about technical feasibility:\n     - Quote: \"We believe implementing AI for product recommendations is technically feasible.\"\n     - Analysis: Assumptions about AI implementation suggest a belief in technical feasibility but require further validation.\n\n5. Research Opportunities:\n   - Specific research activities:\n     - Conduct user testing on the mobile app to understand user behavior.\n     - Gather feedback on product information presentation to simplify content.\n     - Explore customer preferences for customer service channels to align with business goals.\n   - Stakeholders for inclusion:\n     - Finance department for budget approval.\n     - Customer service team for insights on pain points and preferences.\n     - IT department for technical feasibility assessments.\n   - Areas needing deeper exploration:\n     - User testing on mobile app.\n     - Integration points between CRM and e-commerce systems.\n     - Customer service cost reduction strategies.\n\n6.
