# Daria Interview Tool - Project Journal

## Project Overview
Daria Interview Tool is an AI-powered research interviewing platform currently in recovery phase after RC2 release. The system uses LangChain for orchestration, with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities for conducting automated interviews.

## Current Build Status
- **Release**: Post-RC2 Recovery Branch
- **Active Branch**: recovery-branch-fix
- **Core Features Working**: Interview flow, LangChain integration, TTS/STT, data storage
- **Key Recent Fix**: Debug Toolkit with end-to-end automation for interview flow
- **New Prototype**: Daria Memory Companion feature for project continuity

## Database Implementation Status
- **Current Storage**: JSON file-based storage
- **Planned**: Progressive migration to structured database (PostgreSQL or DynamoDB)
- **Database Schema**: Initial DynamoDB schema created but not fully implemented
- **Tables Designed**: 
  - Core: InterviewSessions, Transcripts
  - Analysis: Sprints, Opportunities, Personas
  - Output: AgileArtifacts, CursorPrompts
  - Management: Prototypes, JourneyMaps
  - New: ProjectJournal, TimelineEvents (for Memory Companion)

## Phased Implementation Plan

6. Persistent Memory Companion for project continuity

## Questions to Address
1. Priority of database implementation vs. AWS deployment
2. Preferred database technology (PostgreSQL vs. DynamoDB)
3. Timeline for next official release (RC3)
4. Scope of sprint engine features for initial release
5. Integration approach for Memory Companion feature

## Session Notes
### Session 5 (May 15, 2025)
- **Character Identity and Context Leakage Fix**

- **Problem Summary:**
  - The DARIA interview tool had two critical issues:
    1. **Character Identity Issues**: AI characters weren't maintaining consistent identity across sessions
    2. **Context Data Leakage**: Raw internal context data was appearing in responses

- **Root Causes:**
  - **Character Identity Issues**:
    - Character information wasn't properly passed between pages (session â†’ remote interview)
    - Custom characters like "Thomas" weren't properly registered in the system
    - Character information wasn't persisted in URL parameters when transitioning between pages
    - LangChain response generation wasn't consistently using character information
  
  - **Context Data Leakage**:
    - Insufficient sanitization regex patterns couldn't detect all formats of leaked context
    - LLM responses containing raw context data (e.g., "I am {'Topic': 'General Interview'...}")
    - No fallback detection for suspicious content patterns

- **Implemented Fixes:**
  1. **Enhanced Context Data Sanitization**:
     - Created more robust regex patterns to detect various context data formats
     - Added fallback detection for suspicious content patterns
     - Improved cleaning of responses after context removal
  
  2. **Character Identity Persistence**:
     - Modified URL handling to preserve character between pages
     - Added character parameter to remote interview links
     - Updated identity response handling to be character-aware
     - Added all standard characters to direct mapping dictionaries
  
  3. **Debug Tools Improvements**:
     - Added character passing between debug_character_test.html and debug_interview_flow.html
     - Enhanced character detection in debug tools
     - Added test guide with Thomas character for verification

  4. **Session Handling Improvements**:
     - Modified LangChain integration to properly retrieve and use character information
     - Fixed session creation to copy character information from guides
     - Added explicit character information to system messages

- **Verification**:
  - Successfully tested with custom "Thomas" character
  - Verified character persistence in remote interview sessions
  - Confirmed that context data no longer leaks into responses
  - Character identity remains consistent through entire conversation

- **Files Modified**:
  - langchain_features/services/interview_service.py
  - static/debug_character_test.html
  - static/debug_interview_flow.html
  - templates/langchain/session.html
  - templates/langchain/interview_welcome.html
  - langchain_features/services/discussion_service.py
  - run_interview_api.py
  - data/discussions/thomas_test_guide.json

- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Character state needs to be explicitly passed and maintained across all transitions
  - Robust sanitization requires multiple layers of pattern detection
  - Test guides with specific characters are valuable for verification
  - Custom character handling requires explicit mapping in multiple places

### Session 4 (May 12, 2025)
- I'll update the memory log with our recent AWS deployment progress for the Daria project. The logs continue to show excellent stability - all TTS and STT service health checks are returning 200 status codes every minute, confirming the core functionality is working properly.
- 
- We've successfully:
- 1. Created a "Hello World" test app using Flask in AWS CloudShell
- 2. Verified it works with curl tests to both the main page and health endpoint
- 3. Identified the security challenges with Deloitte's AWS environment
- 4. Drafted a ServiceNow ticket requesting appropriate access permissions
- 5. Confirmed that the main Daria application continues to run flawlessly
- 
- The EC2 deployment is our next step once we receive the security permissions. We've made excellent progress on the incremental approach to AWS deployment that we outlined in our build plan.
- 
- Is there anything specific about today's progress you'd like me to emphasize in the memory log update?

### Session 3 (May 10, 2025)
- Here's a summary of what we've accomplished today:
- 
- ### Memory Companion Configuration & Integration
- - Fixed port conflicts between the main Daria application (port 5025) and Memory Companion (port 5030)
- - Updated all documentation, HTML files, and scripts to reference the correct ports
- - Modified the debug toolkit HTML to properly link to the memory companion on port 5030
- - Updated configuration files in multiple locations (debug_toolkit.html, memory_companion_info.html, DARIA_MEMORY_COMPANION.md)
- - Created proper start scripts that initialize services on their correct ports
- 
- ### Service Deployment & Verification
- - Successfully deployed and tested all services:
-   - Main Daria application (port 5025)
-   - Memory Companion (port 5030)
-   - Text-to-Speech service (port 5015)
-   - Speech-to-Text service (port 5016)
- - Confirmed integration with OpenAI API for LLM responses
- - Fixed issues in start_daria_with_memory.sh to ensure reliable startup
- 
- ### Implementation Testing
- - Tested Memory Companion API endpoints
- - Verified memory persistence between sessions
- - Confirmed the "50 First Dates" concept works as intended with Daria remembering project context
- - Tested the boot sequence and journal visualization components
- 
- ### Documentation Updates
- - Updated all relevant documentation to reflect the new port configuration
- - Made sure setup instructions accurately guide users to the correct URLs
- - Ensured a consistent approach to using the debug server vs. production server  
- 
- The system now successfully maintains project context across sessions and all components work together properly on their designated ports.
