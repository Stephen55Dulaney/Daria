  - Query param: `fields` (comma-separated list of fields to export)
  - Example: `/api/session/abc123/export_csv?fields=title,project,analysis`
  - Returns a CSV file with the selected fields.

---

## 5. **Quality-of-Life Improvements**

### **Error Reporting**

# üü¢ What does ‚Äú3,M‚Äù mean in Cursor?

- **3**: There are 3 linter or static analysis problems (errors or warnings) in the file.
- **M**: The file is ‚ÄúModified‚Äù (has unsaved or uncommitted changes in your git working directory).

**What to do:**
- Click on the ‚Äú3‚Äù in Cursor to see the list of problems. They may be syntax errors, unused imports, or other issues flagged by your linter.
- If you want, I can review the file for you and suggest or make fixes for those 3 problems.

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Let me know if you want to see a sample React component for any of these features.
- If you want me to review and fix the 3 problems in `run_interview_api.py`, just say so and I‚Äôll do it right away!

Would you like to proceed with the React UI, or should I address the linter problems in your backend file first?
