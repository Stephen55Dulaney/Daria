Verify the welcome message appears and TTS plays it\n4. Speak your test question: \"I would like to verify that we can do an interview and everything works for about three questions\"\n5. Verify STT captures your speech correctly\n6. Wait for the AI response (should now work with LangChain enabled)\n7. Verify the TTS plays the AI response\n8. Speak another question like \"What kind of information can you help me with during this interview?\"\n9. Verify the complete cycle works for 3-4 questions\n\n### Phase 2: Remote Interview Testing\n1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5025/discussion_guides to select a guide\n2. Select one of the guides and create a new session\n3. Copy the session ID from the URL\n4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5025/interview/[SESSION_ID]?remote=true&accepted=true in a new tab\n5. Verify the welcome message appears and TTS plays it\n6. Test speaking responses and verify STT captures them correctly\n7. Test typing responses in the text input and clicking the send button\n8. Verify the AI responds appropriately to each input\n\n### Phase 3: Monitor Interview Testing\n1. While keeping the remote interview tab open, open http://127.0.0.1:5025/monitor_interview/[SESSION_ID] in another tab\n2. Verify that the monitor shows the conversation history correctly\n3. Continue the conversation in the remote interview tab\n4. Verify that the monitor updates in real-time\n5. Try sending a message from the monitor and verify it appears in the remote interview\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n\n1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors\n2. Look at the server logs for any backend issues\n3. Verify WebSocket connections are established correctly\n4. Check that the audio visualization shows microphone activity\n5. Ensure permissions for microphone access are granted\n6. Verify TTS audio is playing correctly\n\nThe most important thing was starting the server with the `--use-langchain` flag, which you were missing before. Now the LangChain integration is enabled, and you should get proper AI responses.\n\"",
