  "context": "The Daria application is being rebuilt from scratch to enhance user research and interview processes. This comprehensive tool aims to integrate features such as interview flow management, report generation, UI improvements, persona generation, journey mapping, and AI model integration. The goal is to support researchers by providing robust tools for conducting and analyzing interviews, generating detailed personas, and mapping user journeys. This will enable researchers to gain deeper insights into user behaviors, needs, and pain points, ultimately leading to more user-centered design and development.",
  "goals": "Implement a robust interview flow with text-to-speech questions and speech-to-text responses.\nCreate a feature that compiles interview data into comprehensive reports, with export options.\nUse AI models to generate detailed personas and visualize user journeys, integrating with AI services.",
