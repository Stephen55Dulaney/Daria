Testing the transcript.

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:02:04
Morning, Stephen. How are you?

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:02:05
Morning, how are you? Good, good. Thank you for joining today. Do I have your permission to do a transcript and a recording?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:02:14
Yes, absolutely. Happy to help with this.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:02:20
Great, thanks. So today I wanted to talk to you about the ordering portal for washing machines. Can you tell me a bit about your experience using it?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:02:35
Sure. We've been using the portal for about six months now. Initially, there was a bit of a learning curve, but now my team is pretty comfortable with it. The main advantage is that we can place orders outside of business hours, which is really helpful.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:03:02
That's good to hear. Can you walk me through how you typically place an order using the portal?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:03:10
Of course. I log in with my credentials, then navigate to the product catalog. I usually know exactly what models we need, so I use the search function to find them quickly. Then I add the quantities we need to the cart, review the order, and submit it. 

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:03:32
The system then gives me an order confirmation number which I save for our records. Usually within an hour or so, I get an email confirmation as well.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:03:46
I see. And have you experienced any challenges or frustrations while using the portal?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:03:55
Yes, a few. The search functionality could be better. Sometimes when I search for a specific model number, it doesn't return any results unless I format it exactly right. Also, the order tracking information isn't always up to date, which can be frustrating when customers are asking about their deliveries.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:04:20
That's helpful feedback. How do you currently track the status of your orders?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:04:28
I go to the 'My Orders' section and look for the order number. It shows a status, but as I mentioned, it's not always current. Sometimes I end up calling the customer service line for updates, which defeats the purpose of having a self-service portal.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:04:48
I understand. Are there any features or tools you wish the portal offered that it currently doesn't?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:04:58
Definitely. I'd love to have a bulk upload option where I could just upload a spreadsheet of our order rather than adding products one by one. Also, it would be great if there was a way to save "favorite" or frequently ordered items for quick reordering. Oh, and better reporting would be helpful for our inventory management.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:05:25
Those are excellent suggestions. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience with the portal?

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:05:35
I think that covers the main points. Overall, it's been a positive change from our old process of calling or emailing orders. It just needs some refinement to make it truly efficient.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 08:05:50
Thank you for your time and insights, Ted. This has been very helpful.

[Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:05:57
You're welcome, Stephen. Happy to help improve the system.
