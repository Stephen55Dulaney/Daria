# DARIA Memory Journal

## May 22, 2025 - Getting All Four Services Running

### What Worked
- Successfully created multiple startup scripts to run DARIA with LangChain enabled
- Created mock services for TTS (port 5015), STT (port 5016), and Memory Companion (port 5030)
- Main DARIA API server (port 5025) sometimes starts and responds to health checks
- Python 3.13 compatibility patches for pydantic ForwardRef issues
- Simplified version (`run_daria_simplified.py`) works but lacks LangChain integration

### What Didn't Work
- Main issue: LangChain initialization fails with abstract class errors:
  ```
  Can't instantiate abstract class BaseLanguageModel without an implementation for abstract methods 'agenerate_prompt', 'apredict', 'apredict_messages', 'generate_prompt', 'invoke', 'predict', 'predict_messages'
  ```
- Syntax error in `discussion_service.py` around line 318 (duplicate elif block)
- Python 3.13 compatibility issues with pydantic and LangChain
- Address binding conflicts when running multiple services

### Next Steps
1. Fix syntax error in `langchain_features/services/discussion_service.py` (line 318)
2. Complete the OpenAI adapter to implement all abstract methods required by LangChain
3. Fix `interview_agent.py` to properly use the OpenAI adapter
4. Create a comprehensive startup script that:
   - Patches pydantic ForwardRef issues
   - Creates mock services when real ones aren't available
   - Properly initializes LangChain with a working LLM adapter
   - Starts all four required services in the correct order

### Most Promising Approach
The `start_daria_fixed.sh` script came closest to working - it reported success with:
- DARIA API server
- Discussion guide endpoint
- Session endpoint

Will resume tomorrow at 5:30am CST.
